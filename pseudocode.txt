Snake:
    Every Frame:
        poll for user input
        update player pos (bound checking with walls and snake)
        if (player.gets_food()) 
            generate new food
            grow tail by one


How does move work?
    .you only control the head node of the snake
    then next node takes old position of head node, etc... until tail
    .Since you can only grow by moving onto tile of food, we can generate new tail by setting it to old position of the current tail.

Does C have a built in timer class?
    .We need to restrict movement to only updates per seconds (or milliseconds)
    .C has <timer.h>
    .We need to have one timer control all logic in the game
    .So we have it in the main loop and just pass dt to functions
    .What happens if we pass dt into say update movement, and it's not a large enough delta?
        .maybe have an accumulator inside each class? seems weird
    .Or we just don't pass dt into functions, just only call functions once dt passes certain threshold in loop, then reset

It seems nice to store the snake as a linked list (movement, adding new tail)
    .How would we translate that linked list into points in an array?
    .maybe just store coordinates in each Node obj
    .To update, we just iterate through linked list ()
        .if (input == up)
            int old_x;
            int old_y;
            old_x = head.x;
            old_y = head.y;
            new_x;
            new_y;
            head.y += 1 (With error checking)
            while (cur_node = node.next != NULL) {
                new_x = old_x;
                new_y = old_y;
                old_x = cur_node.x;
                old_x = cur_node.y;
                cur_node.x = new_x;
                cur_node.y = new_y;
            }
            if (picked_up_food) {
                list.add(new node(old_x, old_y);
            }
